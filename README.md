An API for image processing that can be used in two different ways:

1. As a ***simple placeholder API*** for rapid prototyping that allows you to place images into your frontend with the stylization you prefer via URL parameters.
2. As a ***library*** to serve properly processed and scaled versions of your images to the frontend to reduce page load size.
